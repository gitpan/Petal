Petal version 0.71
==================

Petal stands for "Perl Template Attribute Language". It is inspired from the
Zope Page Templates TAL specification, and lets you write elegant, WYSIWYG
friendly templates such as:

<ul petal:condition="user/list">
  <li petal:repeat="user user/list"
      petal:content="encode:user/login">
    Dummy UserName
  </li>
</ul>

Petal prefers to process XML template files (that can be SVG, XHTML, VoiceXML,
whatever) using XML::Parser, however for convenience HTML is also supported
(using HTML::TreeBuilder).
